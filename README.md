# Anomaly-Detection
Capstone project, working with the Wildlife@Home project to create an anomaly detection algorithm.

This program is designed to be run on the Wildlife@Home server. An anomaly detection (or outlier detection) algorithm will be created to run over the video that has been collected by the trailcams for the Wildlife@Home project. This algorithm will capture any animal, human, man-made object, or anything else out of the ordinary that appears in the frame. This will let the biologists who work on the project know which portions of the video that they should study.
